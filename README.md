- pip: This is the Python package installer. It usually comes with the Python installation.
- Git: You will need this to clone the project repository. If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Additionally, this project requires the following Python libraries:
- scikit-learn
- nltk

## 2. Installation Process

Follow the steps below to install and set up the Python Email Classifier utility:

1. **Clone the repository**
   
    Open your terminal and execute the following command to clone the project repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/python-email-classifier.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   Change your current directory to the project's directory:

    ```bash
    cd python-email-classifier
    ```

3. **Install the required Python libraries**

   Run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 3. Verification Steps

To verify that the installation was successful, try running the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

If the application starts without any errors, then you've successfully installed the Python Email Classifier utility!

## 4. Post-Installation Configuration

Before you can use the Email Classifier, you need to provide it with the directory containing your email data. Replace `data_dir` in the following line of `main.py`:

```python
classifier = EmailClassifier(data_dir="/path/to/your/data")
```

Replace `"/path/to/your/data"` with the actual path to your directory containing email data.

Once you've done this, you're ready to use the Python Email Classifier utility!

# Email Classifier User Guide

The Email Classifier is a Python utility that uses AI to classify and filter emails, identifying spam, and prioritizing important messages. This guide provides a detailed explanation of how to use this utility, including basic and advanced usage examples.

2. [Common Use Cases](#common-use-cases)
3. [Parameters](#parameters)
4. [Expected Output](#expected-output)
5. [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage)

## Basic Usage <a name="basic-usage"></a>

This section provides a basic example of how to use the Email Classifier. Here's a simple Python code block demonstrating the usage:

```python
classifier = EmailClassifier("path_to_data_directory")

# Load data
email_contents, email_labels = classifier.load_data()

# Train the classifier
classifier.train(email_contents, email_labels)

# Predict label for new email
prediction = classifier.predict("New email content")
print(prediction)
```

In this example, you initialize the EmailClassifier with the directory containing your email data. Then, you load the data, train the classifier, and predict the label for a new email.

## Common Use Cases <a name="common-use-cases"></a>

The Email Classifier can be used to:

1. **Filter Spam Emails**: The utility can be used to classify incoming emails and filter out spam emails.

```python
classifier = EmailClassifier("path_to_data_directory")

# Load data and train the classifier
email_contents, email_labels = classifier.load_data()
classifier.train(email_contents, email_labels)

# Classify incoming emails
for email in incoming_emails:
    if classifier.predict(email) == 'spam':
        # Move email to spam folder
```

2. **Prioritize Important Emails**: The utility can be used to identify important emails and prioritize them.

```python
classifier = EmailClassifier("path_to_data_directory")

# Load data and train the classifier
email_contents, email_labels = classifier.load_data()
classifier.train(email_contents, email_labels)

# Classify incoming emails
for email in incoming_emails:
    if classifier.predict(email) == 'important':
        # Show email notification
```

## Parameters <a name="parameters"></a>

The main parameters for the Email Classifier are:

* **data_dir** (str): The directory containing the email data.

## Expected Output <a name="expected-output"></a>

The `load_data` method returns a tuple containing the email contents and their corresponding labels. The `predict` method returns the predicted label for the new email, which can be 'spam', 'important', or 'normal'.

## Advanced Usage <a name="advanced-usage"></a>

The Email Classifier can be combined with other utilities for more advanced usage. For example, you can use it with an email client to automatically classify and filter incoming emails.

```python
email_client = EmailClient()
classifier = EmailClassifier("path_to_data_directory")

# Load data and train the classifier
email_contents, email_labels = classifier.load_data()
classifier.train(email_contents, email_labels)

# Classify and filter incoming emails
for email in email_client.get_incoming_emails():
    label = classifier.predict(email.content)
    if label == 'spam':
        email_client.move_to_spam(email)
    elif label == 'important':
        email_client.mark_as_important(email)
```

In this example, the Email Classifier is used to classify incoming emails from an email client and perform actions based on the predicted labels.

## Overview
This Python library provides the `EmailClassifier` class, a utility for classifying emails based on their content using a trained AI model.

## Class Description
The `EmailClassifier` class is the main class in this library. It is responsible for loading email data, training a model to classify emails, predicting email classes, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Method Descriptions

### `EmailClassifier.__init__(self, data_dir: str)`

This method initializes an instance of the `EmailClassifier` class.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `data_dir` | `str` | The directory containing the email data. |

#### Return Value
This method does not return any value.

---

### `EmailClassifier.load_data(self) -> Tuple[List[str], List[str]]`

This method loads the email data from the data directory.

#### Parameters
This method does not accept any parameters.

#### Return Value

| Return Value | Type | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| Tuple | `Tuple[List[str], List[str]]` | A tuple containing two lists: the email contents and their corresponding labels. |

## Code Examples

### Initializing the `EmailClassifier` and loading data

```python
email_classifier = EmailClassifier('path/to/your/data')
content, labels = email_classifier.load_data()
```

## Common Patterns and Best Practices

1. Always provide the full path to the data directory when initializing the `EmailClassifier`.
2. Before making predictions or evaluating the model, ensure the model is trained on a sufficiently large and diverse dataset.
3. Regularly update and retrain your model as new email data becomes available to maintain high classification accuracy.
4. Always handle exceptions especially when loading data to avoid runtime errors.
5. It's good practice to split your data into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of your model.
